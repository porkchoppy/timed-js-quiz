# Timed-JS-Quiz

## Description
This repository links to a timed quiz in which there are six multiple choice questions to test your knowledge on JavaScript. The quiz is timed, and each time an incorrect answer is selected 5 seconds are docked from the timer. The quiz is over when all questions have been answered or the timer has run out. At the end of the quiz, there is an option for you to log your score and initials on the scoreboard. 


## Usage

Here is an example of the questions and the timer counting down.
